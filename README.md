# python-caesar-cipher
Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This is a caesar cipher code for Python.

Example: if you encode (right shift) by 2 letters, then A would be replaced by C
